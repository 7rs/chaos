## 1.20.1  

  1.20.1 is chosed because it has the most supported mods.
  Moreover, this version is compatible with NeoForge and Forge and, Sinytra Connector supports it.  

## Forge  

  Between NeoForge and Forge, NeoForge seems better.
  But, some mods incompatible with NeoForge because we keep to use Forge.
  About Fabric, there is Sinytra Connector, and there are far more mods that support Forge.
  Considering these factors, we use Forge instead of Fabric.
