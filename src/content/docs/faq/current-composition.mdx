## 1.20.1  

  Why is 1.20.1 chosen? Because many mods supports 1.20.1.
  Moreover, Forge and NeoForge are compatible only in 1.20.1.
  Also, a lowest version supported by Sinytra Connector.

  Candidates were 1.19.2 and 1.16.5.

## Forge  

  Many would consider NeoForge is better than Forge. I agree.
  However, although they should be compatible, a small part of mods don't work in NeoForge.
  While, Fabric is light and fast, but kinds of the mod are biased.

## Embeddium  

  There are many graphics mods in Minecraft.
  Why is Embeddium chosen? we will explain with comparison.  

#### Optifine  

  Optifine isn't distributed in CurseForge and Modrinth.
  Overmore, it isn't compatible with many mods.  

#### [Magnesium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium-reforged)  

  Development has no longer and only 1.16.5 is supported.  

#### [Rubidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/rubidium)  

  Development has no longer.
  Also, Rubidium's author contributed to Embeddium, so it seems like entrusted to Embeddium.  

#### [Xenon](https://modrinth.com/mod/xenon-forge)  

  Xenon is started as a fork of Embeddium.
  However, it's updated less frequently than Embeddium.  

#### [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium)  

  The best mod in Sodium's Forge port at this time.
