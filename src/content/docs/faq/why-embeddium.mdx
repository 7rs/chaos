## Why does select version 1.20.1?  

  Because I believe newer versions are more promising than older, and almost mods are compatible 1.20.1.  

  Furthermore, Mods that supports 1.20.1 are the largest in versions 1.20+,
  and 1.20.1 is compatible with both [NeoForge][neoforge] and [Forge][forge].  

## Why not use Fabric?  

  Because number of [Forge][forge] mods larger than number of [Fabric][fabric] mods.  

  But [Fabric][fabric] is faster and lighter than [Forge][forge],
  so I wanna support [Fabric][fabric] in the future.  

## Why not use NeoForge?  

  Because [NeoForge][neoforge] is stopped maintenance to 1.20.1.  

  Gonna migrates if [NeoForge][neoforge] supports new Forge version.  

## Why not use Optifine?  

  Not available rather than not use.  
  Because [Optifine][optifine] isn’t distributed on [Modrinth][modrinth] or [CurseForge][cursforge],
  and redistribution isn’t permitted.  

  Also, [Optifine][optifine] isn’t compatible some mods,
  and there’re some [Optifine][optifine] version incompatible some [Forge][forge] version.
  Overmore, [Optifine][optifine] almost features were implemented by official and mods.

## Why not use other mods that are optimize rendering?  

  Because [Embeddium][embeddium] is maintained.  

### Magnesium  

  [Magnesium][magnesium] hasn't been updated since 2021.  

### Rubidium  

  [Rubidium][rubidium] hasn't been updated at 2023,
  and [Rubidium][rubidium] owner is working on development of [Embeddium][embeddium].  

### Acedium  

  [Acedium][acedium] is only available to nvidia users and [Acedium][acedium] isn't lighter than others.
