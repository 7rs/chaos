## Why is a version selected 1.20.1?  

  I was considered 1.16.5 and 1.19.2,
  but I believe newer versions are more promising, and almost mods are compatible 1.20.1.  
  Furthermore, Mods that supports 1.20.1 are the largest in versions 1.20+,
  and 1.20.1 was compatible with both NeoForge and Forge.  

## Why not used Fabric?  

  Because Forge mods larger than Fabric mods.  
  But Fabric is faster and lighter than Forge, so wanna supports Fabric in the future.  

## Why not used NeoForge?  

  So NeoForge is stopped maintenance to 1.20.1.  

## Why not use Optifine?  

  No disrespect to Optifine, because Optifine wasn't a good for development of Chaos.  

### Incompatible  

  Optifine isn't compatible some mods.
  There're some Optifine version that isn't compatible some Forge version.
