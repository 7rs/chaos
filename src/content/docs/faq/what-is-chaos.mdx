Chaos is the modpack that include mods from any genres.  

## Issues  

  There're many mods on [Modrinth][modrinth] and [CurseForge][curseforge] and they're too many to play.
  Then why not just add all mods wanna play?  
  But doesn't work it and gets issues. Chaos is resolved them.  

### Compatibility  

  Naturally, if you add many mods, they conflicts.  
  Chaos avoids adding mods that conflicts and adds mod that improves compatibility.  

### Game Balance  

  Mods that aren't intended to be used together can destroy moods.
  Many modpacks select mods or change settings to adjust game balance.  
  Chaos adjusts game balance by raising difficulty.  

### Fast and Light  

  Some mods do heavy processing and if add more mods, more processings go up.  
  Chaos do speed-up without overloading the computer.
