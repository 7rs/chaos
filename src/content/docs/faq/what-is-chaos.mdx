title: What is Chaos?
---

  Playing Minecraft with mods requires a lot of processes, whether you are a noob or an expert.
  So, Chaos was developed to reduce the process.  

---  

  First, factors that increase the process are as follows:  

### Versions  

  Each mod supports different Minecraft versions and mod loaders.

### Compatibility  

  The game might not work if mods are incompatible.  

### Library Mods  

  Some mods require library mods.  

### Performance  

  Added mods cause lag and performance drops.  

---  

  These "Versions", "Compatibility", and "Library Mods" can be solved.
  Because we will distribute modpacks or a binary to generate modpacks with a single command.  

  What about "Performance"?
  Playing with industrial waste that doesn't even run vanilla minecraft is wrong, so we won't solve that problem.
  The goal is the low load without lag.
  Shader mods won't be lighter, but the performance problem can be solved.
